# Task 3 - Text Generation using Markov Chains ðŸ§ 

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech** under the domain **Generative AI**.

---

## ðŸ§¾ About the Project

This project uses a simple **Markov Chain algorithm** to generate new, random text based on patterns from a given input corpus. The program reads a text file, analyzes word pairs, and then predicts new sequences that mimic the style of the original content.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How Markov Chains work in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text modeling using Python dictionaries
- Randomized generation based on probabilistic patterns
- How to build simple AI-like behavior using classic algorithms

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Install Python
2. Add input text in `input_corpus.txt`
3. Run the generator:

```bash
python markov_text_gen.py
